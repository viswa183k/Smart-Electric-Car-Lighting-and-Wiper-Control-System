# Smart Electric Car Lighting and Wiper Control System  

### 📌 Overview  
This project automates **headlight and wiper operation** using sensors. It switches headlights ON in darkness and activates wipers when rain is detected, improving driving safety and comfort in Electric Vehicles.  

### ⚡ Features  
- Auto headlight control based on ambient light  
- Automatic wiper activation on rain detection  
- Energy-efficient control for EV applications  
- Simple, low-power microcontroller design  

### 🛠️ Components Required  
- Arduino UNO  
- LDR (Light Sensor)  
- Rain Sensor Module  
- Relay Modules (for headlights and wipers)  
- Power Supply  

### 🚗 Applications  
- Electric car body control systems  
- Autonomous vehicle sensor modules  
- EV lighting and safety automation
